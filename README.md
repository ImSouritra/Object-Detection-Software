# Object-Detection-Software
Computer vision has advanced considerably but is still challenged in matching the precision of human perception. Image recognition software, also known as computer vision, allows applications to understand images or videos. With this software, we can capture real time video by frame to frame , and a computer vision algorithm provides an output, such as a label or bounding box. There are many objects rather classes which our model can detect. Now this is a very small model just for experiement purposes, which'll run on any computer. These capabilities are typically embedded inside intelligent applications. Image recognition software can be used by data scientists to train image recognition models, as well as developers looking to add image recognition features to other software. The type of user would determine the format in which this software is accessed, whether that be via a machine learning library or framework, an API or SDK, or via an end-to-end platform.

## How to run this on your computer
It's very simple. Just download the build folder and then run the "main.exe" file.
